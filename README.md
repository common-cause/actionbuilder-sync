# ActionBuilder Sync

Keeps participation data in [ActionBuilder](https://actionbuilder.org) current by syncing activity from Common Cause's other platforms. Built as a dbt project running entirely in BigQuery.

---

## What It Does

Reads participation records from Mobilize, Action Network, and ScaleToWin, computes the correct tag values for each activist in ActionBuilder, compares them against what ActionBuilder currently shows, and outputs a table of changes. A custom sync script (provided by The Movement Cooperative) reads that table and makes the ActionBuilder API calls.

**Current state (2026-03-19):**
- Tag updates — `update_records` now instrumented with sync_log (2026-03-16); not yet run on production schedule pending taggable_logbook fix
- Deduplication — executed: 154 emails migrated, 91 phones migrated, 8,921 entities removed from campaigns
- New record insertion — executed: 3,532 entities inserted 2026-03-12
- Sync log — live: `actionbuilder_sync.sync_log` records API calls for remove_records, insert_new_records, update_records, and cleanup_duplicate_tags
- AB mirror bug — evidence captured 2026-03-16/17 (`evidence/` dir); AB bug filed with Willy; taggable_logbook stale since 2026-03-05

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- dbt-bigquery 1.11+ (`pip install dbt-bigquery`)
- A BigQuery service account with read access to all source datasets and write access to `actionbuilder_sync`
- Git Bash (on Windows) or any Unix shell

### 1. Clone and configure credentials

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd "ActionBuilder Sync"
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD={"type":"service_account","project_id":"proj-tmc-mem-com",...}
```

The value is the full contents of your service account JSON key file (on one line, no surrounding quotes).

> **Note:** Do not `source .env` in bash — the JSON value will break. Use `bash dbt.sh` instead, which handles credential loading via Python.

### 2. Verify setup

```bash
bash dbt.sh debug
```

Should report all checks passing.

---

## Running dbt

```bash
# Deploy all 25 views to BigQuery
bash dbt.sh run

# Deploy a single model
bash dbt.sh run -s dedup_candidates

# Run data tests
bash dbt.sh test

# Compile SQL without deploying
bash dbt.sh compile
```

All commands go through `dbt.sh → run_dbt.py`, which loads `.env`, writes the credential JSON to a temp file, sets `BIGQUERY_KEYFILE_PATH`, and calls `dbt` with whatever arguments were passed.

## Data Flow

```

`updates_needed` reads from both sides and outputs only the rows where the correct value differs from the current value, formatted for the sync script.

## BigQuery Datasets

| Dataset | Role |
|---------|------|
| `actionbuilder_sync` | **This project's output** — all views managed here |
| `actionbuilder_cleaned` | Cleaned AB database tables (`cln_actionbuilder__*`) |
| `core_enhanced` | Cross-platform identity hub (links emails/phones to person_ids) |
| `mobilize_cleaned` | Cleaned Mobilize event participation data |
| `actionnetwork_cleaned` | Cleaned Action Network user/action data |
| `scaletowin_dialer_cleaned` | Cleaned ScaleToWin call records |
| `ep_archive` | EP internal shift data |
| `actionnetwork_views` | Reference tables (states, etc.) |
| `targetsmart_enhanced` | Voter file (address fallback in new-record load) |

## Key Files Outside This Repo

- **The sync script** — `scripts/sync.py` in this repo; reads dbt views and makes AB API calls. Operations: `update_records`, `insert_new_records`, `remove_records`, `prepare_email_data`, `prepare_phone_data`, `apply_assessments`. All write operations log to `sync_log`.
- **Duplicate tag cleanup** — `scripts/cleanup_duplicate_tags.py`; standalone script that deletes duplicate taggings via the AB API and logs `delete_tagging` operations to `sync_log`. Also deployed as `civis/cleanup_duplicate_tags.sh`.
- **Credentials** — stored in `.env` (gitignored). The `BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD` env var holds the full service account JSON.
- **ccef-connections library** — at `../AI Interpretation/ccef-connections`; provides BigQuery, Airtable, Zoom, Sheets, Action Network connectors. Used for any Python scripts that need to query BigQuery directly.

## BigQuery MCP (Claude Code)

When working in Claude Code, the global `bigquery` MCP is available and pre-approved for this project. Use it to query views directly without leaving the conversation:

```
bq_query("SELECT * FROM actionbuilder_sync.updates_needed LIMIT 10")
bq_list_tables("actionbuilder_sync")
```

The MCP connects to `proj-tmc-mem-com` using the shared `BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD` service account from the meta-project `.env`. No per-project credential setup is required for Claude Code queries — only `dbt` / `run_dbt.py` reads the local `.env`.

## Roadmap

1. **[Done]** Manage views as code via dbt (replaced BQ GUI)
2. **[Done]** Tag removal — sync now replaces values rather than accumulating them
3. **[Done]** `dedup_candidates` — identifies duplicate AB entities across five tiers
4. **[Done]** `email_migration_needed` / `phone_migration_needed` — contact info consolidated before deletion (154 emails, 91 phones migrated)
5. **[Done]** `deduplicated_names_to_load` — new-record insertion feed, fully guarded against re-creating existing entities
6. **[Done]** Dedup execution — 8,921 entities removed from campaigns, 3,532 new entities inserted (2026-03-12)
7. **[Done]** Sync log architecture — `sync_log` BQ table + dbt wrapper views compensate for BQ replication gaps; sync.py instruments remove_records and insert_new_records
8. **[Active]** Resolve open `dedup_unresolved` pairs (currently 16 same-campaign ambiguous pairs)
9. **[Active / AB-blocked]** `taggable_logbook` replication fix — AB's own internal SQL mirror stalled at 2026-03-05 (table too large); bug filed with AB directly (Willy). Evidence captured 2026-03-16/17. `current_tag_values` and `updates_needed` work from stale data until resolved.
10. **[Pending fix]** Run `update_records` on production schedule — blocked until `taggable_logbook` mirror is fixed; script is ready and instrumented with sync_log.
11. **[Future]** New data flows: Airtable, Zoom, Mobilize relational organizing campaign
